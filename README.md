Push Dates for Kanboard Tasks
=============================

This plugin for kanboard adds small buttions on each task card to access frequently used functions.  These functions are:
1) Push the due date of a task out XX number of days (3 customizable intervals and they can be randomized)
2) Add a comment to a card
3) Edit a card
4) Close a card
5) Show the last comment for a task on it's card

These settings are customizable by project.

NOTE: Each Board will now have a "Card Date Push Actions" settings menu.  Using this menu you can set the number of days for up to 3 intervals.  Setting a value of 0 will suppress that corresponding icon from showing.  These settings are board specific.
