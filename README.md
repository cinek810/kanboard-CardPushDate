Push Dates for Kanboard Tasks
=============================

This plugin for kanboard adds small buttions for faster access to push the due date of tasks out by 7, 30 and 365 days

(Credit to the Instantactions plugin - on which this code was originally based - https://github.com/juehv/kanboard-InstantActions)

NOTE: Each Board will now have a "Card Date Push Actions" settings menu.  Using this menu you can set the number of days for up to 3 intervals.  Setting a value of 0 will suppress that corresponding icon from showing.  These settings are board specific.
